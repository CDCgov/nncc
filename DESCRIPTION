Description: This package calculates the distances (Gower, by default) between cases and controls using all confounders for a given exposure. Then uses the distances and a data-driven threshold to identify k nearest neighbors matching controls for each case. Each control is used once. Cases or controls that are not matched are excluded from the analysis.
