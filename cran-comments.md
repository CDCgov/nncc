# Release summary

This is a resubmission of our first submission of this package in response
to the following requests from Victoria Wimmer. 

I think you missed to add \value in one of your .Rd files. Please also add it there as you did in the others.
Missing Rd-tags:
      finalize_data.Rd: \value

>>> Apologies.  I have fixed now.
